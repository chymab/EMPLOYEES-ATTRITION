##THIS REPOSITORY SHOWS THE ATTRITION RATE OF EMPLOYEES  IN AN ORGANIZATION

INTRODUCTION

This project was done in the HR department of a company in Nigeria to analyse the attrition rate of employees and to know the active and none active employees in the company.

##PROBLEM STATEMENT

-To determine the highest  number of attrition in all the departments.
-To record attrition base on educational qualifications.
-To determine the highest age group that was dismissed or resigned overtime.
-To count attrition base on gender.
-To record the KPS and KPI of the collected data.
-To  determine the employees that worked satisfactorily.

##DATA SOURCE

This data was culled online from an Analyst,posted by my instructor and reworked on by me.
##SKILLS AND CONCEPTS
This work is an excel project converted to tableau by me for more analysis.

DATA ANALYSIS



VISUALISATION
-An all round survey of the employees data were done before the commencement of the analysis.
-I was able to calculate different attrition rate base on departments,qualifications,age and gender.
-I was also able to calculate the KPS and KPI of the whole data collected,including how the employees worked satisfacctorily.
-I was able to put in place the grand total of all the job roles in the different department.
-In education,i gathered that many employees in life sciences left the company.
-Also the sales executive carried out their jobs satisfactorily more than the other departments.
-Those within the ages of 25-34 who are male left the company.
-Both male and female employees are still single.

RECOMMENDATION

-From my analysis,it can be seen that the employees in the highest attrition are all youths and single,therefore i recommend that married people should be considered more during interviews because my analysis shows that they cherish their job more than the younger ones.

-Enquiries should be made on the department of life science to identify the reason for the high rate of attrition (if they were sacked or resigned).

-The sales executives should be appreciated at the end of the year to encourage them to work harder the coming year and those who need to be promoted should be given promotion to boost the morale of the other employees targetting promotion.

-Because of the high rate of male youth attrition,i think their reason for leaving should be verified and recorded to avoid future occurrance.
